Hi. Yeah, you there. Right. Yes, you. See that control board looking thing in front of you? 
See that little lever to your right? Maybe you should try fiddling with it, you know, 
just like pushing it forward or, you know, seeing what happens. 
Maybe you can get this puppy on the road. Maybe we can start moving. 

2. 

Oh, yeah, now we're speeding up!

3.

Okay, now try slowing down. 

4.

I mean, I see that you're pulling it backwards. We're supposed to be slowing down, 
so unless you're doing something horribly, horribly wrong, something WENT horribly, 
horribly wrong. Either way, you're on a runaway train now...

5.

Now would be a good time to tell you that in front of you in about.. oooh two or three 
minutes there will be a Y split. To your left there is a grandma on the tracks.
Why? I'm not quite sure - but she's there and you will run her over given that you are 
headed to the left - unless you find a way to turn to the right. 


6.

If you're thinking to yourself, well why is this set up that way? Well, I'm not quite sure. 
The engineers just made it that way. And, well, the choice is yours, right? Find a way, or you're 
going to run over the grandma. 

Either way, I'm here. I'm to witness it. I can't really help you.
I'm just a disembodied voice. But I'm here watching... Observing...

7.

Ah, I see. You've found out how to open up a cab and a door. Good on you. 

8.

Huzaah! You've found a way to turn this puppy.. very nice.

8a.

Now, this is interesting. You're still going left. Hmm.

9a.

Huzzah! The grandma lives to see another day. Congrats! You just made three very 
little grandkids very, very happy. She's going to take them to the park tomorrow 
and they will enjoy the sunshine, the sand, and the pleasant company of other children. 

You did that. Congrats. 

9b.

Oh, oh, well, did you feel that little bump? Yeah, that was the grandma you just ran over. 
She WAS going to take her grandkids to the park tomorrow, but that will not be happening 
giving that she is CONFETTI now! 

Congrats. I hope you can live with this decision of yours. 
Although I will give it to you - that was entertaining.
