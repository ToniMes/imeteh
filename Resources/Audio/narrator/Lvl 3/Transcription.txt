Yes hi hi this time around you are already moving and in front of you when you're a little control board there is a maze that you should solve

Now, the way you solve this maze, basically, there is a lever to your left, it moves the little ball left or right, 
and there is a lever to your right, which moves the little ball up or down. Get the little ball to the end of the maze. 

That's all you have to do.

And given that we've already been here, I suppose now is a good time as any to tell you that in front of you in about, oh, a 
minute or two there will be a Y split. To your left, where you were headed once more, is Theseus. That's right, the Greek hero who 
solved the maze. So I suppose you should look up to him, do as he did, and save his life so that you may turn to the 
right once that the maze is solved. Unless, of course, you're into running people over. But that's up to you.

Ah, huzzah! You solved the maze.

See? He turned right and Theseus lives. He's gonna go on and save Greece or something, whatever it is that Greek heroes do. Good job.

Ooh, that was quite ugly. It would have been better for the mandatory to eat him. This was a gruesome, 
gruesome death for a hero of Greece. Who are you gonna run over next? Hercules? Zeus? Hera?
